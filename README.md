# EtherLogistics 
Is made to *reduce* time and recourses needed for a traditional CMR or other documents circuiting around the European Union to complete its journey. 
Our solution is based on **blockchain** (Ethereum protocol), its **Decentralised and Distributed**, and as new *researches proof* is a durable and immutable medium, it is extremely safe and reliable.
## Main establishment:
- Every European Ministry is a Node in a closed blockchain net 
- Every Node can upload and read data on blockchain 
- Users - logistic companies can register in an app provided by their Node's which is extremely flexible
### Main Features:
1. Data is Unchangable
1. Data is Distributed
1. Accessibility rights control
1. Stability and efficiency 
1. Identity Authorisation 
#### Details:
* Unchngable data is related to blockchain's immutability - now what does it mean, it means that once data is put in blockchain it can not be changed or deleted, unless you have strictly determined permissions (not a thing for simple Nodes)
